    - In Build Settings search for 'Framework search path'
    - In framework search path add the path ~/Documents/FacebookSDK

6> Right click the Info.plist > Open as > Source Code
    - I have added the code to the the file and commented it where ever necessary

7> Open AppDelegate.m
    - I have added the following code to the file and commented where necessary

#import <FBSDKCoreKit/FBSDKCoreKit.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application
      didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
        // Add any custom logic here.
          return YES;
    }
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
  BOOL handled = [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application
                                                                openURL:url
                                                      sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                                                             annotation:annotation
                  ];
  // Add any custom logic here.
  return handled;
}



8> Now you can import the LoginManager from react-native-fbsdk and use it as necessary
  - I have added a sample code in index.ios.js
